- Edit and delete authors.
- Add, edit, and delete books.

**Note:** Any changes made to the options mentioned above will be applied directly when working with the user.

## User Features:

When a logged-in user interacts with the website, they can:

- View the website, including a shopping cart feature.
- Specify the quantity for each book and remove books from the cart.
- Utilize additional features to enhance the website according to their needs, without interfering with the administrator's work.

The website also includes two pages at the end:

- **Blog:** Coming soon.

For users who are not logged in, they are unable to purchase books or add them to the shopping cart. They also cannot view all available books and other additional features unless they log in.

## Database Import

To import your "final_project2.sql" database into XAMPP or WAMP, you can use the built-in phpMyAdmin tool in both of them. Here are the basic steps to import the database:

1. Start XAMPP or WAMP and make sure that the MySQL services are running.
2. Open a web browser and go to [http://localhost/phpmyadmin/](http://localhost/phpmyadmin/). The phpMyAdmin user interface will appear.

### For XAMPP:

3. In the phpMyAdmin page, navigate to the **Import** tab in the top menu.
4. In the "Choose a file to import" section, click the "Browse" button and select the "final_project2.sql" file you want to import.
5. Choose "UTF-8" as the encoding for the file.
6. Click the "Go" button at the bottom of the page and wait for the database import to complete. A message will appear when the import is finished.

### For WAMP:

3. In the phpMyAdmin page, the database will be automatically imported when you place the database files in the `wamp64\bin\mysql\mysql{version}\data` folder. Copy the "final_project2.sql" file to this folder.
4. Restart the MySQL service in WAMP.
5. After the restart, the database should be imported automatically and ready for use.

After importing the database, you can access it by connecting to the database using the application or program you desire.
